    \item[Deep waters:] Quest for integrable models. Computation of breathers in higher-order models.
    \item[Full Euler:] Development of fast and arbitrarily accurate algorithms for the computation of regular and singular travelling gravity and capillary-gravity wave solutions. Direct simulation of the free surface Euler dynamics
    \item[Tsunami generation:] Study of the energy transfer from the bottom motion to water waves. Construction of realistic co-seismic bottom displacements during underwater earthquakes
